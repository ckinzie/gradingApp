Deleting a comment affects the ordering of the applied comment. If a student has comments 0,2,3 applied and I delete comment 1 from the list, then the table does not update. If I click on that student, comments 0 and 2(which used to be 3) will be clicked, even though all three should be selected. (**attaching an id to each comment instead of referencing by index may fix this**)
Clicking delete when nothing is selected throws an error but does not affect the program
Need to save before exporting as .txt or the .txt will not be fully updated with grades and comments
