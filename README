Project Number 7

Project due date: July 31th

Brief Review of Project description as stated in my Specification for the Project:
  The application I am constructing is a grading app that will help me log grades and comments when grading lab assignments. The main GUI will be a table setup with a column for "Students", "Grades", and "Comments". I will be able to log comments and calculate students' grades automatically instead of counting up the deductions by hand.

The easiest part of this project:
  Calculating the grades based on comments were pretty easy

Problems that I had in completing this project:
  Saving comments to a grade sheet and applying then to specific students took me a while to figure out, but it's working now.

How successful was I in achieving the objectives as stated in my Specification for the first Deliverable (Project #5):
  I believe I have accomplished everything I stated in my deliverable minus tabs. I'm not sure I will be able to finish the tabs by the end of course, but I did consider that a stretch goal that is not neccessary for the functionality of the application.

What are my objectives for Project #7, the second Deliverable?
  For the final deliverable, I want to polish as much as possible and remove any bugs I find. I would also like to add a couple of the stretch goals like the partners column and a few of the preference menu buttons.
