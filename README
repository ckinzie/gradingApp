Project Number 8

Project due date: August 8th

Brief Review of Project description as stated in my Specification for the Project:
  The application I am constructing is a grading app that will help me log grades and comments when grading lab assignments. The main GUI will be a table setup with a column for "Students", "Grades", and "Comments". I will be able to log comments and calculate students' grades automatically instead of counting up the deductions by hand.

The easiest part of this project:
  Overall, creating the buttons and the menu bar were probably the easiest tasks to complete.

Problems that I had in completing this project:
  Saving comments to a grade sheet and applying then to specific students took me a while to figure out, also, creating the table was difficult, but the example project you sent me help tremendously.

How successful was I in achieving the objectives as stated in my Specification for the first Deliverable (Project #5):
  I believe I have accomplished all of the basic goals that I stated in my deliverable. I was unable to finish my stretch goals such as tabs, partners, and some of the stylistic options in the menu bar. I want to keep working on this project and hopefully add those features in the near future.
  One bug my program has is that deleting a comment all together affects the ordering of the applied comments for a student. If a student has comments 0,2,3 applied and I delete comment 1 from the list, then the table does not update. If I click on that student, comments 0 and 2(which used to be 3) will be clicked, even though all three should be selected. I may be able to fix this by attaching an id to each comment instead of referencing each comment by index. Also, if I try to delete a comment or student when nothing is selected in the listbox, an error gets thrown, but does not affect the running of the program.
